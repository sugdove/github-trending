Fun learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!    I'm Sahand, a web developer in computer science.   I've been doing this for over a decade.

This is a skill you'll learn in this course.    This new course teaches students how to install Visual Studio Code and its extensions.    Then we start from scratch with each project.    After finishing HTML, it's on to CSS and JavaScript.    Building in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is fine.    This guide explains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.    Every project is started from scratch and finished without using copied code.    Then they are used on the project to ensure everyone understands.    This program's exciting project-based curriculum includes building modern, super cool, and responsive websites!    Let's get started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
