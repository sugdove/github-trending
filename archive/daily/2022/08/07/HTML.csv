Fun learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!    I'm Sahand, a web developer in computer science.   I've been doing this for over a decade.

After finishing HTML, it's on to CSS and JavaScript.    Building in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is fine.    This guide explains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.    Every project is started from scratch and finished without using copied code.    Then they are used on the project to ensure everyone understands.
